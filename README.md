# 🌦️ WeatherAQI: Weather & Air Quality Comparison

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to extract and analyze real-time weather and air quality data for selected cities (e.g., Los Angeles, Yucaipa). It combines API-based data extraction with basic web scraping or manual AQI input to create clean visual comparisons of environmental conditions.

## 🔧 Features
- 🔄 Live integration with OpenWeatherMap & AQI APIs
- Auto-generated visual comparisons for multiple cities
- Visualizes metrics with labeled, unit-based bar plots
- Fully implemented in Python with pandas, requests, seaborn, and matplotlib

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Optional: BeautifulSoup (for scraping AQI)

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Real AQI scraping from official sources
- Fahrenheit vs Celsius toggle
- CSV export or time-series tracking

## 📁 How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WeatherAQI.git
